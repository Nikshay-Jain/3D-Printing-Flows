# 3D-Printing-Flows: Transport Phenomena in 3D Printers
A research-driven analysis of heat and fluid flow mechanics within 3D printers for additive manufacturing.

---

## ‚ú® Features
- Comprehensive fluid and heat transfer modeling in 3D printers (ABS, PLA)
- Validated governing equations, advanced Rheology (Carreau-Yasuda Model)
- Error analysis via Richardson extrapolation and grid convergence index
- Visualizations: velocity, temperature, viscosity, and system sensitivity plots
- Industry applications & recent developments (multi-material, 4D printing)

---

## üöÄ Quick Start/Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nikshay-Jain/3D-Printing-Flows.git
# (Optional) Open 3D-Printing.pdf for full research
# TeX source: main.tex for compilation via pdflatex/main LaTeX editors
```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage
- Review compiled results in `3D-Printing.pdf` for theory & analysis
- Modify `main.tex` for custom fluid/thermal models, system geometry
- Update figures and computation results as needed; insert images into main.tex
- Use the documented governing equations for extensions/applications

## üìé Files
- main.tex (LaTeX source)
- 3D-Printing.pdf (compiled research)
- [*.png, *.jpg] (visual data/plots)
